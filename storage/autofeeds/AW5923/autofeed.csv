It is part of the brand&amp;rsquo;s identity and acts as an indelible signature on the product.The contact surface of the new KEO 2 MAX preserves the strong lines on which its history was built. Its width has been increased to 60 mm to provide a larger platform and improved foot stability during pedalling. This creates a feeling of unrivalled comfort not found in any other pedal.We also sought to optimize power transfer thanks to its new 500 mm&amp;sup2; of usable surface (+25% increase). The shape of the stainless-steel plate has been revised to match that of the cleat and to keep, regardless of the position of your foot (depending upon the angular float you use), the same amount of contact for consistent performance.Increasing the pedal&amp;rsquo;s usable contact surface, without any additional weight gain, improves the Power to Weight ratio, making the product even better and allowing you to perform at your best.IMPROVED SPINDLE PROFILEThe spindle profile of the new KEO 2 MAX has also been optimized. Built around an oversized &amp;laquo;Chromoly Plus&amp;raquo; steel axle, it is composed of an axle with an inner ball bearing and a needle roller bearing, located under the contact surface, to handle the load and distribute it optimally.A new component has been added between these two bearings. A serrated washer, previously used to hold the needle roller bearing in place, has been replaced with a conical spacer. This technical solution reduces friction, increases fluidity, and by consequence, decreases the geometrical tolerances of the pedal body and play.The sole purpose of the sum of these improvements has been to guarantee you irreproachable reliability.SPECIFICATIONSUSAGE: Recreational to CompetitionBODY: CompositeAXLE: Chromoly +PEDAL STACK HEIGHT + CLEATS: 17,3 mmCONTACT SURFACE AREA: 500 mm&amp;sup2;FLOAT: 8 or 12 adjustable springCLEATS: K&amp;eacute;o Grip CleatsPEDAL WEIGHT: 130 gr (328 gr per pair with cleats and screws)COLOURS: Black or WhiteACCESSORIES: A pair of Grey K&amp;eacute;o Grip cleats + screwsGUARANTY: 2 years",Cycling,79.99,"Ribble Cycles",5923,252,https://images2.productserve.com/?w=200&h=200&bg=white&trim=5&t=letterbox&url=ssl%3Acheckout.vsf-m2.prod.ribblecycles.co.uk.cfstack.com%2Fmedia%2Fcatalog%2Fproduct%2Fl%2Fo%2Flookpeda200.jpg&feedId=5923&k=e31c653a6c695ef16e1ee4d5ef2d5574cf9aa006,,3.00,GBP79.99,,,,,,

AT ONE WITH THE MACHINE                Whether its your favourite or nemesis ride, you visualise it in your head the night before, you know the roads like the back of your hand, every corner, climb and descent it’s as if you were there already….then press start, click in, change down, your off, the anticipation as you glide out of town and onto the rolling roads up to the foot of the first climb.The head wind doesn’t bother you “tail wind home you say to yourself”. As the climb draws near your conserving energy ready to hit it hard to beat that PB or take the KOM, the climb rolls on and you pass a few riders in their own moment of pain and ecstasy, the gradient steepens but your feeling good, 100m to go that final push out of the saddle and the PB is yours, you’re the King of this Mountain.Then focus your mind for the rewarding descent, the spoils for your effort unfolds in front of you, swooping down it’s as if you’re on rails, the swish of the tyres and the sound of the wind, at one with the machine.Then the road opens up, your back on the rolling roads with more climbs and technical descents to come but there covered with poise and grace. The miles count down until you see the sign for home, one last push you change down 2 gears wind up the pace, down 2 more gears and you’re out of the saddle sprinting for the finish, you cross the line, your home, exhilarated with a sense of accomplishment….This is the essence of the Ribble Endurance SL!    .copy__wrapper {    max-width: 1280px;    margin: 64px auto 0;    text-align: left;    font-size: 14px;    line-height: 26px;    overflow: hidden;}.copy__wrapper + .media__wrapper {    margin-top: 32px;}.copy__header {    width: 35%;    font-family: 'Univia Pro','Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;    font-size: 50px;    line-height: 50px;    font-weight: 700;    color: #273032;    box-sizing: border-box;    padding: 20px;    margin-bottom: 20px;    float: left;}.copy__header__highlight {    color: #00b3e3;}.copy__content {    float: left;    width: 65%;    font-family: 'Univia Pro','Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;    color: #666666;    letter-spacing: 0;    line-height: 29px;    box-sizing: border-box;    padding: 20px;    font-size: 16px;}.copy__content .heading {    color: #273032;    font-size: 32px;    font-weight: 600;    margin-top: 32px;    margin-bottom: 8px;    font-family: 'Univia Pro','Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;}@media (max-width: 768px) {    .copy__header {        padding: 32px 32px 16px;        width: 100%;    }    .copy__content .heading {        font-size: 24px;        margin-top: 24px;        margin-bottom: 4px;    }    .copy__content {        padding: 0 32px 16px;        width: 100%;        font-size: 14px;        line-height: 26px;    }}",Cycling,2099.00,"Ribble Cycles",5923,252,https://images2.productserve.com/?w=200&h=200&bg=white&trim=5&t=letterbox&url=ssl%3Acheckout.vsf-m2.prod.ribblecycles.co.uk.cfstack.com%2Fmedia%2Fcatalog%2Fproduct%2Fe%2Fn%2Fendurance-sl-black-di2-12-speed_side-on_2.png&feedId=5923&k=e6e04f8a6fcc46acd957d4259cb264f779fb2883,,40.00,GBP2099.00,,,,,,

As the climb draws near your conserving energy ready to hit it hard to beat that PB or take the KOM, the climb rolls on and you pass a few riders in their own moment of pain and ecstasy, the gradient steepens but your feeling good, 100m to go that final push out of the saddle and the PB is yours, you’re the King of this Mountain.Then focus your mind for the rewarding descent, the spoils for your effort unfolds in front of you, swooping down it’s as if you’re on rails, the swish of the tyres and the sound of the wind, at one with the machine.Then the road opens up, your back on the rolling roads with more climbs and technical descents to come but there covered with poise and grace. The miles count down until you see the sign for home, one last push you change down 2 gears wind up the pace, down 2 more gears and you’re out of the saddle sprinting for the finish, you cross the line, your home, exhilarated with a sense of accomplishment….This is the essence of the Ribble Endurance SL!    .copy__wrapper {    max-width: 1280px;    margin: 64px auto 0;    text-align: left;    font-size: 14px;    line-height: 26px;    overflow: hidden;}.copy__wrapper + .media__wrapper {    margin-top: 32px;}.copy__header {    width: 35%;    font-family: 'Univia Pro','Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;    font-size: 50px;    line-height: 50px;    font-weight: 700;    color: #273032;    box-sizing: border-box;    padding: 20px;    margin-bottom: 20px;    float: left;}.copy__header__highlight {    color: #00b3e3;}.copy__content {    float: left;    width: 65%;    font-family: 'Univia Pro','Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;    color: #666666;    letter-spacing: 0;    line-height: 29px;    box-sizing: border-box;    padding: 20px;    font-size: 16px;}.copy__content .heading {    color: #273032;    font-size: 32px;    font-weight: 600;    margin-top: 32px;    margin-bottom: 8px;    font-family: 'Univia Pro','Helvetica Neue',Arial,sans-serif;}@media (max-width: 768px) {    .copy__header {        padding: 32px 32px 16px;        width: 100%;    }    .copy__content .heading {        font-size: 24px;        margin-top: 24px;        margin-bottom: 4px;    }    .copy__content {        padding: 0 32px 16px;        width: 100%;        font-size: 14px;        line-height: 26px;    }}",Cycling,2099.00,"Ribble Cycles",5923,252,https://images2.productserve.com/?w=200&h=200&bg=white&trim=5&t=letterbox&url=ssl%3Acheckout.vsf-m2.prod.ribblecycles.co.uk.cfstack.com%2Fmedia%2Fcatalog%2Fproduct%2Fe%2Fn%2Fendurance_sl_teal_di_12_speed_side_on_2.png&feedId=5923&k=73a4dddc9ef7f721535f7c1f0b958c67daea8c95,,40.00,GBP2099.00,,,,,,

Not just designed to be the fastest when tested in isolation, but the fastest in the real world. Delivering watt-saving gains achieved across all areas of the frameset, the Ultra SLR has been optimised to perform around 5-10&amp;#176; of YAW commonly experienced by a cyclist. Every aspect of this pioneering aero frameset is engineered to scythe through the air with class-leading efficiency and scalpel-like precision.  The Ultra Aero cockpit forms an integral element of the Ultra SL R's world-leading aerodynamic innovation. Designed entirely around rider and bike interaction, adding wake generators to the underside of the bars creates a Drag Reduction Zone (DRZ) for the rider's leg to sit within, resulting in a net drag reduction of around 2.1% for bike and rider. This translates to an average 23.2-second of advantage over a full YAW sweep at 22mph over 40km when compared to our already aerodynamically optimised LEVEL 5 handlebar system.
