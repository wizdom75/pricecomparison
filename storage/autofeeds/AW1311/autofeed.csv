For direct streaming, its Bluetooth receiver allows quick and easy connection and with aptX technology you will enjoy CD quality sound from compatible devices. With a broadband internet connection MRx comes alive and allows access to internet radio and an almost infinite library of music through online services such as Spotify, Deezer and Tidal, with Amazon Music also coming soon. Moreover you can also stream music stored on other networked computers and also from your&nbsp;phone.  Our stylish controller located on the front of MRx allows volume and source to be easily changed, but for full remote control we have a dedicated app for iOS and Android devices called Ruark LINK. This allows full control of all MRx functions and also displays information on the source material being played.  LINK also allows users to create and manage groups when two or more MRx units are being used together as part of a multi-room system. R2 Mk3 and R7 Mk3 are also compatible with MRx and can also be controlled with the Ruark LINK app. A dedicated webpage showing the features of LINK will be available&nbsp;soon.  With an internet radio tuner built in, MRx gives you virtually unlimited access to radio stations at home and abroad. If you&rsquo;re living away from home, you can stay connected with your favourite stations through the wonders of internet radio and if you love country or jazz then you can search worldwide by musical genre to find stations that specialise in the type of music you love. MRx also allows you to access radio podcasts and catch-up services, notably programmes from the BBC, so if you ever miss a show you can catch up at your&nbsp;leisure.  With its &lsquo;multi-room&rsquo; capabilities you can wirelessly link and sync MRx with additional MRx or our R2 Mk3 and R7 Mk3 models, so you can distribute music all around your home. Set-up and control of multi-room configuration and groups is performed using our soon to be released app for iOS and Android devices called Ruark LINK. This allows control of each device in the group, so volume etc. can be balanced to your&nbsp;liking.  Alongside its wireless connectivity, MRx also has great direct connectivity, with a combined line-in and digital optical input allowing auxiliary devices such as a turntable, Amazon Dot, Google Chromecast or Apple AirPort Express to be easily connected. Also featured is a USB playback port which allows you to conveniently playback music stored on a memory stick or portable hard drive in a variety of popular audio codecs. Furthermore, all these inputs are multi-room enabled, so if desired can be streamed wirelessly to other MRx or our R2 Mk3 and R7 Mk3&nbsp;models.  MRx has been designed for wireless connectivity, but also we&rsquo;ve included an ethernet socket so MRx can be wired to a network if required. A wired ethernet connection ensures reliability in playback and can also prove useful if you want to use MRx where the wi-fi signal from your home router is variable or weak. In this case, ethernet powerline adaptors can be used and provide an easy to use solution to resolve network&nbsp;problems.  &nbsp;","Wireless Speakers",419.00,"Electrical Discount UK","HiFi Speakers",1311,15,"GB:0.00 GBP",Ruark-Audio,,GBP419.00,,,,,,090660102565

Additional features include pan detection, pan overheat detection, variable rate dual circuit grill, conventional oven and easy clean enamel. A/A energy rating.  The flexible multi-function oven gives you 9 ovens in 1, incorporating functions including defrost, fanned oven, conventional oven, top heat, base heat, base heat with fan, intensive bake, fanned grilling and conventional grilling giving you more control over your cooking. An even temperature is achieved through the fanned oven as the air is circulated by an integral fan, so any shelf can be used making more use of the space &ndash; perfect for batch batching. A fanned oven also allows you to cook different foods together without transferring flavours. The conventional electric oven is ideal for traditional roasting, this type of oven is hotter at the top than the bottom.  You can put your meat in the middle, roast potatoes towards the top and a pudding towards the bottom. The 4 zone induction technology works by heating the plan rather than the hob, offering smarter, faster, and safer and more energy efficient way to cook. This model only needs hardwiring into a&nbsp;32amp&nbsp;power supply. So you won&rsquo;t have to pay an electrician hundreds of pounds to upgrade to a&nbsp;45amp&nbsp;supply as you&rsquo;d have to do with most other induction range cookers.  Dual circuit variable electric grills let you adjust the grilling power to suit but, with faster preheat times and the precision of a temperature dial. For smaller portions you can use just the inner section of the grill width for economy, using the full width of the grill if you&rsquo;re feeding the family.  Normally when you close the door on your grill, it stops grilling and starts baking at high heat. That&rsquo;s why Stoves designed their grills to work with the door open, keeping the air circulating and grilling your food to perfection.  If you lift your pan off the cooking zone, the pan detection function will automatically reduce the power, helping to save energy. If the pan used is not suitable for an induction hob then a symbol will flash to let you know.  With the programmable timer, you can prepare your dish and place it in the oven ahead of time, set the timer to switch the oven on and off and sit back and relax.  The Sterling&nbsp;600MFTi&nbsp;is designed with a removable inner glass door and easy clean enamel to make cleaning your oven a breeze.

In similar fashion, Airfree continually draws in air from the room, heating it to over 200 &ordm;C and instantly sterilising it. The purified air is then cooled inside the device before being returned to the room.

Opti-myst fires require water to be added and minimal regular cleaning.  The magic of an Opti-myst fire Theres nothing quite like the effect of a fire.  It creates a wonderful feeling of comfort and cosiness. Looking deceptively real, an Opti-myst fire will capitivate you from the moment you see it. The fully 3-dimensional effect creates authentic looking flames and smoke delivering a warm and cosy atmosphere to any room. with its Revolutionary technology The flame and smoke effect is created using ultrasonic waves which atomise water to create an extremely fine mist. This is not steam since the water is at room temperature and, therefore, the flames are safe to touch. As the mist is so fine it does not add significantly to the humidity of the room.  Dimplex has fine-tuned the ultrasonic transducer to produce the most realistic flame and smoke effect possible. Anti-microbial additives For added peace of mind, an anti-microbial substance has been added into the plastic material used in Opti-myst fires. Also, a report by the Microbiology Department, University College Cork concluded that the unit offers no risks to use from a microbiological perspective.  Easy to clean It is recommended to use filtered water in Opti-myst fires. If tap water is used, a build up of limescale can seriously hinder the production of flame and smoke effect. However, if a build up of limescale does occur, the plastic materials used have a highly polished finish to ensure easier cleaning and removal of limescale.
