What is a Planar Dynamic Driver? Sometimes referred to as orthodynamic headphones planar magnetic headphones differ to the more traditional dynamic headphone. Dynamic headphones generate sound by using a coil of wire (often called a voice coil) attached to a diaphragm and a suspension is created to allow the coil and diaphragm to move back and forth like a piston moving enough air to produce sound. However depending on the quality of the dynamic headphone speaker cone there will be inconsistencies across the frequency spectrum meaning that though many dynamic headphones have a very nice sound signature they are not necessarily 100% accurate when they reproduce an audio signal. Dynamic headphones also deteriorate quicker over time. In contrast planar magnetic headphones use an incredibly thin lightweight and resilient film diaphragm (around 1/10th the thickness of a human hair) stretched over a sturdy frame and placed between magnetic arrays. In these headphones the coil is unwound and spread across this film diaphragm. As the current flows the magnetic field is created within the headphone that causes the diaphragm to move. The film diaphragm in planar magnetic headphones is often lighter than the air it is moving meaning that they can be driven with an incredible accuracy. The sound they produce features faster transients more responsive bass more detailed highs and a wider dynamic range than other headphones. As the voice coil is spread over a larger area than in traditional headphones planar magnetic headphones are also much better at dissipating heat and can handle a huge amount of power without distorting. Overall this type of headphone features higher sensitivity can play louder with tighter control and reduced colouration and ...","Headphones & Earphones",249.17,"Advanced MP3 Players",Headphones,361,22,0.00,HiFiMan,SUNDARA,GBP249.17,6925624201500,,,,,

Through optimizing the damping and internal structure the air pressures at the front and rear cavities of the FH7 are balanced relieving uneven pressure from your eardrums for greater comfort when listening. The FH7&rsquo;s shell is made of aerospace-grade aluminium-magnesium alloy shaped by five-axis CNC machining. Stunning on the outside but also powerful on the inside - 4 Knowles DFK+SWFK BA driver units The FH7&rsquo;s 4 Knowles balanced armature drivers plus a beryllium dynamic driver perfectly cover all parts of the sound frequency spectrum through sophisticated crossover and turbo acoustics design High and ultra-high frequencies: These parts of the frequency spectrum are handled by the Knowles DFK+SWFK BA driver often utilized in top-of-the-line IEMs. This driver is extremely detailed but without being harsh giving you natural crystal-clear sound. Mid frequencies: This is handled by a custom BA driver designed by FiiO and Knowles in conjunction with each other. FiiO took the classic Knowles 30017 driver and tweaked it to give the mids more body for fuller and sweeter vocals as well as a larger soundstage. Low frequencies: The 13.6mm large dynamic driver is made of beryllium known for being light thin yet extremely rigid for even deeper explosive bass.

Hearing is precious and needs to be protected from a young age as even short-term exposure to loud volumes can cause permanent hearing loss in children. KidJamz child-safe headphones use volume-limiting technology to ensure that the audio your kids are streaming from their devices is safe so you don&rsquo;t have to constantly monitor how they listen to movies music and games. KidJamz Volume-Limiting Technology While regular headphones and earphones can easily exceed safe volumes by 50% or more KidJamz utilizes a proprietary volume limiter built into the structure of the speakers to maintain the sound pressure level (SPL) below a physician-recommended 85dB* keeping young ears safe and helping create lifelong good listening habits. *85dB limit is based on an industry-standard 1mW audio output of a typical portable audio device. Volume Limiter switch A concealed switch allows parents to disable the volume limiter so that KidJamz can be used in noisy environments. This switch is protected against accidental activation and alternates between volume-limited (85dB) and unlimited modes granting parents full control of the listening experience. Designed with Kids in Mind The best kids&rsquo; headphone is the one kids will want to use so we set out to make KidJamz as lightweight safe and frustration-free as possible. The adjustable headband and vinyl earpad cushions provide a comfortable and secure fit for boys and girls ages 4-12 while the reinforced cable is tough and tangle-resistant.
